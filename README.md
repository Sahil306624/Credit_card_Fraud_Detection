Credit_card_Fraud_Detection

This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using various machine learning algorithms. The study involves Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier, comparing their performances in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Credit card fraud detection is an increasing concern due to the rise in online transactions. This project aims to develop a fraud detection system using machine learning algorithms to identify and prevent unauthorized transactions. The algorithms used in this project are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Both undersampling and oversampling techniques are applied to the data to determine the most effective algorithm for fraud detection.

Introduction
Fraud detection in credit cards involves monitoring cardholder activity to estimate and prevent unauthorized transactions. The increase in internet users has led to a rise in fraudulent transactions, both online and offline. While data mining techniques exist to detect these frauds, they often lack accuracy. This project uses efficient machine learning algorithms to enhance fraud detection.

Methodology
The project uses three machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression: A statistical method for binary classification that calculates the probability of an input belonging to one of two categories.
Decision Tree Classifier: A supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to classify data based on feature values.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions for a final outcome.
